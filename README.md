# Vulture

**Third-Party AI Behavior Mod for SPT 4.x**

---

## Overview

Vulture adds realistic "third-partying" behavior to AI bots. When gunshots or explosions occur, nearby bots will opportunistically move toward the combat zone to ambush weakened survivors. This creates more dynamic, unpredictable raids where firefights attract AI predators.

## Features

- **Gunshot Detection** - Bots hear unsuppressed gunshots and react
- **Explosion Detection** - Grenades also trigger vulture behavior
- **Multi-Shot Intensity** - More shots in an area = higher response chance
- **Smart Ambush** - Bots use cover points and choke positions
- **Silent Approach** - Crouch-walking to ambush points
- **Flashlight Discipline** - Bots disable lights/lasers when stalking
- **Squad Coordination** - Followers join when leaders vulture
- **Boss Avoidance** - Bots avoid vulturing toward boss fights
- **SAIN Integration** - Personality-based vulture chance modifiers
